Application: pycnumanal  (Python/SQL/C numerical analysis)

A Python/SQL program that, choosing from a collection of C numerical analysis programs, calls one of them with a user-specified problem size (n). The C program outputs the time required to run with that problem size. The Python program stores these timings in a database, allowing it to later display graphical plots of the timings (seconds) vs. problem sizes (n). It supports displaying the timing curves of multiple programs on the same plot for comparison purposes.

- builds on the final version from pycnumanal-lessons
- here, I am developing it for myself, not as a series of lessons for others

- pycnumanal.py is the master Python file

- see instructions.txt to run it
