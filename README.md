Application: pycnumanal  (python/C numerical analysis)

A Python program that, choosing from a collection of C numerical routines (or algorithms), calls one of them with a user-specified problem size (n). The C code reports back the time required to run with that problem size. The Python program stores these timings, allowing it to later display graphs of the timings (seconds) vs. problem sizes (n). It supports displaying the timing curves of different algorithms on the same graph for comparison purposes.
