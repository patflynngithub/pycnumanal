Application: pycnumanal  (python/C numerical analysis)

A Python program that, choosing from a collection of C numerical routines (or algorithms), calls one of them with a user-specified problem size (n). The C code outputs the time required to run with that problem size. The Python program stores these timings in a database, allowing it to later display graphical plots of the timings (seconds) vs. problem sizes (n). It supports displaying the timing curves of multiple programs on the same plot for comparison purposes.
